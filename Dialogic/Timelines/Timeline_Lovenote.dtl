evidence_lovenote: My perfect Primrose, the flowers are jealous of your beauty. The birds envy the songs you sing. Soon we will be together for all eternity, and to symbolize my love for you I've spent my life savings on two gold rings of everlasting love. We shall wear them the night we leave this wretched world to the Booglo and frolic into the next life together as you promised.
