Character_Farmer: Welp. The name's Herbert. I farm the best turnips and don't you ever let anyone tell you different.
- Tell me about yesterday...
	Character_Farmer: During the day I played some cards with that Alexander fellow and did pretty well. 'Course at night a Booglo was summoned in my field, ruining my turnips.
	Character_Farmer: I'd bet that tavern keeper Harriet had something to do with this, couldn't live knowing my delicious turnips are better than her baked potatoes.

- Tell me about the townsfolk...
	label Townsfolk
	- Tavern Keeper - Harriet
		Character_Farmer: She doesn't buy my turnips. She would rather buy [b]potatoes[/b] from the neighboring town. What goes better with an ale than a fresh turnip?
		Character_Farmer: Everyone's always eating those potatoes instead of my turnips. They don't know what they're missing.

	- Farmer - Herbert
		Character_Farmer: Mmmmhmmm, been farming turnips my whole life. I expect compensation from whoever ruined my turnip field.

	- Chandler - Willard
		Character_Farmer: I know they found some freaky candles at the ritual site and no one could make candles like that but him.
		jump Townsfolk
	- Wizard - Wilton
		Character_Farmer: He claims he summoned that Imp but I happen to know it's a curse he put on himself by [i]accident[/i]. That's what he gets trying to meddle with magical stuff.

	- Guard - Duncan
		Character_Farmer: Pffft! Only cared about those royals. You won't see him sticking his neck out to save my turnips! No one respects my turnips. He did let me know about Wilton's Wonder Wax, it's gonna help my aching back some day.

	- Princess - Primrose
		Character_Farmer: I'm just a simple farmer but I get the feeling that princess was up to something, she had her own royal insignia made. Started putting it on everything.

	- King - Kurtis
		Character_Farmer: We'll have another king telling us what to do before long.

	- Girl - June
		Character_Farmer: Lives out in the wilds with her father, they're a wild bunch. I let them use my barn...when the [i]weather[/i] turns bad. But that hasn't happened for a long time.

	- Hero - Alexander
		Character_Farmer: Another fool to go along with the rest in this town. He came here to slay the beast werewolf. The werewolf never did harm my turnips, and it ate plenty of rabbits. You know what those rabbits eat? That's right, my turnips. I say leave it alone.

	- Imp - Pimmelstix
		Character_Farmer: Lying little bugger. All day long it's flying around pranking and prodding and picking on everyone.

	- Skeleton - ???
		Character_Farmer: Does he look sorta familiar to you?
		jump Others
	- Wildman - Doohk
		Character_Farmer: He loves my turnips. He's the only person besides myself who knows where I hide my barn key. I let him use it for shelter sometimes. I didn't think he needed to anymore since that witch has been around, but of course the one night...nevermind, it doesnt matter.
